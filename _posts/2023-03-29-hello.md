# Hello World

## This is the first post in this blog. 

### How about a code block around here somewhere?
### We can do an easy one. Lets intall homebrew from the website: [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)


``` bash

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

* This script will install homebrew onto your system. 
* homebrew is a package manager and will allow you to install software onto your system through the terminal.
